For years, whenever he had time had resided in a distant, unreachable future. It didn\u2019t anymore. He had the time. Had had the time for a couple months.

Postcards filled his father's cousin's old cigar boxes, while travel trinkets filled a housebound steamer trunk. ->", "completion": " Categorizing what he\u2019d accumulated swallowed the remainder of the morning whole, then ate away at the early afternoon.

{"prompt": "Lehrgen knew civilian aircraft only provided mediocre training for an air force, a method his own country was using. ->", "completion": " That was all well and good, except Lehrgen knew too well that civilian aircraft made for a halfway-trained air force.

Twenty years ago, he\u2019d made Franciszka Nowak laugh when he made that comparison while she showed him the trick to the edible version.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Smiling, he raised the brush, finally seeing his arm muscles defined again. ->", "completion": " As he raised the brush to his face, his lips quirked into a satisfied smile. The definition was finally visible in the muscles that wrapped around his arms once again.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Despite intense training, he knew he'd never be the poster boy for an ideal Imperial soldier. Realizing last summer that full-time office work was detrimental was still a blow. ->", "completion": " Even fresh out of his most rigorous weeks of training, he\u2019d never fooled himself into thinking he\u2019d be featured on the posters showing what the ideal Imperial soldier looked like. That hadn\u2019t made it all so much easier when he\u2019d noticed last summer that full-time office work wasn\u2019t treating him as well as he\u2019d thought.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Despite grueling hours and years at war, constantly moving and surrounded by ambitious soldiers, he couldn't avoid impromptu athletic contests or morning exercises. ->", "completion": " In spite of the punishing hours, the years at war he\u2019d spent constantly on the move, and constantly surrounded by soldiers eager to prove themselves. The impromptu athletic contests or morning exercises had been unavoidable.\n###"}
{"prompt": "It took him six months to establish a workout routine without supervision, balancing ambition and feasibility around his work schedule. Through trial and error, he succeeded. ->", "completion": " Without a commanding officer looking over his shoulder, forming a dedicated routine had taken half a year. It had to fit around his work schedule. Had to be ambitious enough to cram a worthwhile amount of exercise into a short time. Couldn\u2019t be so ambitious he looked for any excuse to avoid it. Trial and error had eventually gotten him there.\n###"}
{"prompt": "After lathering, he hesitated before grabbing the new razor Marian gifted him for Christmas. His old one still hung next to the sink. He should've replaced it years ago with a more practical option. ->", "completion": " Done brushing the lather on, his right hand hesitated for a moment, then grasped for the handle of the new razor Marian got him for Christmas. His old one still dangled by the strap on its case next to the sink. He should have gotten rid of it by now. Should\u2019ve gotten rid of it years ago when he first heard there was a more practical and convenient replacement.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The old razor, familiar only with his face, held no significance for him. He couldn't recall its origin or age. Straight razors were still being made and sold. ->", "completion": " Aside from being intimately-acquainted with the skin on his face, the obsolete razor held no special meaning to him. He couldn\u2019t remember where he bought it, nor how long he\u2019d had it. It wasn\u2019t the last of its kind. Straight razors remained in production and in stock on shelves.\n###"}
{"prompt": "He swapped his pocket watch for a wristwatch, hadn't used non-motorized wheels in ages, and might never again. His tobacco was machine-rolled, candles decorative, and clothes off-the-rack. His life was about practicality and convenience, yet he found rebellion in occasionally using a straight razor. ->", "completion": " He\u2019d traded in his pocket watch for a wristwatch. He didn\u2019t know the last time he rode on wheels not harnessed to the power of internal combustion. Maybe, he never would again. His tobacco came machine-rolled, his candles were a decoration, there wasn\u2019t a single item of clothing in his closet that had been made-to-measure. His life was ruled by practicality and convenience. There was an attractive rebellion to the impracticality and inconvenience of picking up the straight razor when the mood struck.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The familiar routine, slightly modified for the new device, was a lifelong habit. Despite the blade against his neck demanding attention, his mind drifted to weekly tasks, balancing the chore's annoyance with its calming effect. ->", "completion": " The routine, altered some for the new device but not unrecognizably, was one he\u2019d been doing for over half his life, down, down, up, up, right to left, face then neck, calming and refreshing in a way that balanced out the annoyance of the chore. No matter how often he repeated that the blade held against his neck deserved his full attention, muscle memory took over. His mind wandered away, making a list of to-dos for the coming week, reviewing his list from the last one.\n###"}

{"prompt": "I'm unchanged, just rerouted. Erich pictured Tanya's confident smile, amused at any doubt. ->", "completion": " I\u2019m the same as ever. I\u2019ve only had to change my course, not my destination. Erich could imagine the smile pulling on Tanya\u2019s lips while she said it. Confident, undaunted, disbelieving. Amused that anyone would think to question it.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"She'd said, with a predatory grin, that not even God could stop her, her arrogance mocking the entity she deemed second-most powerful.\" ->", "completion": " I wouldn\u2019t let God Himself get in my way, she\u2019d said, mouth drawing wider until it was a parody of a grin, predatory, daring, as arrogance erased religious deference and she mocked the entity she ranked as next-most-powerful.\n###"}
{"prompt": "His blade nicked his skin, causing blood to trickle down his neck. He dabbed it until the bleeding slowed, allowing him to finish without a mess. ->", "completion": " The pinch of skin catching along the edge of his blade pulled his mind\u2019s eye to see what his real eyes did - a rivulet of blood running down his neck. He dabbed at it roughly, just until the bleeding slowed and he could finish the rest of it without making a mess.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Who was he to survive blocking Tanya's path? A man who hurt himself with a safety razor? ->", "completion": " Who did he think he was to survive standing in Tanya\u2019s path? A man who injured himself with a safety razor?\n###"}
{"prompt": "From his cabinet's top shelf, he grabbed the old alum bar, a relic from his days shaving in dimly lit, filthy trenches. He rubbed it over his face and neck, relishing the tingle and the astringent sting that sealed off a small cut. ->", "completion": " Off the top shelf of his cabinet he retrieved the old alum bar he had from days when he was shaving in dim light and dirty mirrors, dirtier hands and squalid trenches ready to turn the tiniest nicks into serious infections. Since he had it out, he rubbed it over the entirety of his face and neck, enjoying the pleasant tingle, not minding the astringent sting that meant it was sealing off the trickle of red when he ran it over his cut.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The skin would seamlessly regrow without his notice, indistinguishable from what was once there. ->", "completion": " The separated skin would grow back together without him noticing, reforming itself so effortlessly he\u2019d have no way of seeing it wasn\u2019t the same as what used to be there.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The old Tanya wouldn't have sought a dentist's name, conscious of her teeth's imperfections, or admitted her inability to make jam, a basic skill for girls her age. She wouldn't have dared to say that civilian life suited her to Lieutenant Colonel von Degurechaff. ->", "completion": " The old Tanya wouldn\u2019t have asked him for the name of a dentist, like any other young woman too aware of her cosmetic flaws and needing repeated affirmations from him that her teeth were acceptably straight, if not perfectly so. The old Tanya wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of blushing or stuttering in embarrassment at admitting she fell so short on typical skills for girls her age she couldn\u2019t make something as simple as jam and so was passing along the work of another woman. Civilian life agrees with me like you wouldn\u2019t believe would not have dared try to pass through Lieutenant Colonel von Degurechaff\u2019s lips.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Gradually, Tanya was transforming, filling the voids left by her old life, though she was unaware. ->", "completion": " Little by little, Tanya was changing, new growth forming as she tried to bridge the gaps that tearing away her old way of life had made. She just couldn\u2019t see it yet.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya disliked celebrating her birthday. Despite her recorded death date being February 22, 2013, she felt her life ended on July 18, 1913. Besides knowing what happens after death, she found little to celebrate. ->", "completion": " On the whole, Tanya wasn\u2019t keen on celebrating her birthday. While she was aware that her day of death would have been recorded as February 22, 2013, subjectively, her memories of the date corresponding to July 18, 1913 on her current calendar were of her life ending, not beginning. With the exception of learning the answer to one of humanity\u2019s all-time favorite questions - what happens after we die? - she couldn\u2019t find much worth celebrating in there.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Unsurprisingly, her perspective was unique. As a young adult, each year brought milestones like graduation and celebratory vices. Her indifference made her stand out. She found it less time-consuming to ignore Being X than to constantly justify her disinterest. ->", "completion": " Predictably, nobody else saw it her way. As someone young enough for each distinct year to come along with its own milestones - people her age were graduating high school and congratulating themselves by buying bottles of liquor and cartons of cigarettes - not caring to acknowledge it made her an anomaly. Ultimately, she\u2019d waste less time raising a glass to another year of not giving into Being X than in making repeated excuses and explanations for why she didn\u2019t want to.\n###"}
{"prompt": "She planned to stop celebrating her age after turning twenty and becoming an eligible voter, using her womanhood as an excuse. ->", "completion": " It was only for another two years. After she hit twenty and marked the final step off the \u201cgrowing up\u201d checklist by becoming an eligible voter, she fully planned on making use of her new gender to claim that as a woman, she didn\u2019t want to celebrate getting any older.\n###"}
{"prompt": "She was ready to endure, but underestimated the extent of it. ->", "completion": " For now, she was mentally prepared to grin and bear it. What she\u2019d failed to calculate was just how much grinning and bearing she\u2019d need to do.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya eyed the first unwrapped gift, expertly disguised by Visha. She felt uneasy about the remaining deceptive pile. ->", "completion": " Tanya stared down at the first gift she\u2019d unwrapped. Visha had disguised the shape so expertly she\u2019d had no idea what she was in for. She was a bit uneasy about what was lying in wait for her in the rest of her innocent-looking pile.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"My uncle's best friend makes it,\" Visha said, crossing her arms. \"It's not store-bought. Let's try it.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cMy uncle\u2019s best friend makes it.\u201d Visha crossed her arms and gave a sharp nod. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy it at the store. Let\u2019s have a taste.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya eyed the plain bottle labeled \"Samogon\", doubting the creator's intent for broad consumer appeal. ->", "completion": " Let\u2019s not, Tanya thought, glancing down at the plain bottle of clear liquor again, the taped-on label reading \u201cSamogon\u201d looking like more of a warning than an advertisement. Whoever this Mr. Samogon was, his product packaging decisions didn\u2019t leave her with much confidence in his desire to create something with broad consumer appeal.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Tanya told Serebryakov firmly, \"Mr. Samogon's vodka may be fine, but it's just past lunch. We're not opening a bottle now.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cSerebryakov,\u201d Tanya said, keeping her voice firm. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Samogon makes perfectly fine vodka, but it\u2019s barely past lunch. We aren\u2019t cracking open a bottle in the middle of the day.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha chuckled, \"Samogon isn't his name, it's homemade liquor.\" ->", "completion": " Visha giggled behind her hand. \u201cSamogon isn\u2019t his name,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you call homemade liquor.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya's discovery of the moonshine didn't ease her worries. Despite knowing its high-proof alcohol sanitized most things, she was still uneasy about drinking an unlicensed product from a likely uninspected woodland facility, where hygiene standards could be overlooked. ->", "completion": " The revelation that she was in possession of moonshine didn\u2019t help the image in Tanya\u2019s head. Knowing that high-proof alcohol sanitized most everything it came in contact with only went so far in allaying her concerns about consuming an unlicensed product from an uninspected facility that she suspected was located in the woods behind someone\u2019s home, where no one would notice the employee didn\u2019t wash their hands after using the hygiene facility known as the nearest tree.\n###"}
{"prompt": "She smiled. \"Thanks. I'll try some after dinner.\" ->", "completion": " She forced a smile onto her face nonetheless. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll try some after dinner.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha frowned. \"So whiskey's okay?\" ->", "completion": " Visha\u2019s lips pursed into a frown. \u201cSo if it\u2019s whiskey, it\u2019s okay?\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya blamed herself for teaching Visha how to create ammunition from anything, wanting to bury her head in her hands. ->", "completion": " More than anything, Tanya wanted to stick her head in her hands. She\u2019d been responsible for Visha\u2019s training. She could only blame herself for teaching the other woman how to make ammunition out of anything your enemy gave you to work with.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya felt Lehrgen's liquid lunch plans were unfair, leaving her to either accept or reject the gift. Unlike Visha, who could take the bottle to avoid rudeness but defer drinking. ->", "completion": " From Tanya\u2019s standpoint, gamely going along with Lehrgen\u2019s liquid lunch plans wasn\u2019t a fair comparison. First off, he\u2019d left her stuck between two extremes: accept the gift or reject it. In Visha\u2019s case, she could accept the bottle to avoid being rude, while simultaneously deferring actual consumption.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The social context was different. Her valued coworkers were all men. Unless Visha saw her as a typical girl, discussing shoes, makeup, or dating, Tanya didn't benefit from being considered \"one of the boys.\" ->", "completion": " More importantly, the interpersonal context was completely different. All of her coworkers whose opinion mattered were men. As long as Visha didn\u2019t consider her \u201cone of the girls\u201d to such a degree their relationship revolved around shoes, make-up, or who was dating who, Tanya gained no particular benefit from having Visha lump her in under the heading of \u201cone of the boys.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"It's your eighteenth birthday and Saturday,\" Visha objected. ->", "completion": " \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday,\u201d Visha objected. \u201cYour eighteenth. This is the time. Plus, it\u2019s Saturday anyway.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "She conceded that one sip wouldn't kill her. ->", "completion": " When she put it that way, there was no arguing around it. At least not without giving offense. She supposed one sip wouldn\u2019t kill her.\n###"}
{"prompt": "After toasting and tapping cafeteria glasses, Tanya feared she might have just drunk gasoline. ->", "completion": " After a toast and a tap of their cafeteria glasses, Tanya wasn\u2019t so sure. There was a strong possibility she\u2019d just ingested gasoline.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha laughed uncontrollably. \"Your face,\" she kept repeating. ->", "completion": " Visha was beside herself with laughter. \u201cYour face,\u201d she repeated, over and over. \u201cOh my God, your face.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"You're mocking me,\" Tanya said, washing the taste away with water. ->", "completion": " \u201cThis time, you are making fun of me,\u201d Tanya noted, once she\u2019d rinsed the taste down with water.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Seen you handle a bullet better,\" Visha hiccuped, gesturing to the remaining gifts. \"Open the rest now.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you take a bullet better,\u201d Visha hiccuped, trying to get herself under control. She gestured towards the rest of the gifts. \u201cNow you can open the rest.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya nervously untied the next item, her fears thankfully unfounded. ->", "completion": " Apprehensively, Tanya undid the tie on the next item. Her misgivings thankfully turned out to be unwarranted.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"I don't know your apartment's decor,\" Visha said, pointing at Tanya's empty case. \"Maybe you'd like to display your medals.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cI don\u2019t know how your apartment is decorated,\u201d Visha said, gesturing at the empty wood-and-glass case Tanya was holding. \u201cI thought you might want to hang your medals up.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya didn't prefer the wall-hanging, but admitted it was better than her current, non-existent art style. ->", "completion": " It wasn\u2019t Tanya\u2019s first choice of wall-hangings. She could admit it would still be an improvement upon her current artistic style, which one might generously refer to as Meditations on Nothingness.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha pointed at the triple picture frame under the shadow box, already holding a photo of their original battalion and one from a ball they attended. \u201cI left a space for a recent photo,\" she said. \"Weiss sent me the smiling photo I requested, but I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d ->", "completion": " \u201cI left one blank in there,\u201d Visha continued, pointing at the item underneath the shadow box, a triple picture frame already containing one photo of their original battalion and one of their group of four from that ball they\u2019d attended. \u201cI figured you might have something more recent you\u2019d want to put in. Weiss sent me the smiling photo I asked you to take, but I\u2019m holding onto that.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya agreed, planning to fill the empty spot with a worthy photo. ->", "completion": " Tanya nodded along. At some point she\u2019d find a photo worth sticking in the empty spot.\n###"}
{"prompt": "She carefully unpacked the next box, revealing a mismatched set of six coffee cups. ->", "completion": " Lifting up the next box was enough to tell her it had been packed so nothing inside could move. Gingerly, she peeled it all apart so she didn\u2019t break the fragile contents. One by one, a mismatched set of six coffee cups came out.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"From the city's best coffeehouses, according to Elya,\" Visha proudly announced. ->", "completion": " \u201cOne apiece from the coffeehouses Elya says are the best in the city,\u201d Visha declared proudly.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya examined each brand. Despite not needing all of Elya's opinions, she wouldn't ignore this crucial information. ->", "completion": " Tanya inspected the branding on each. While she might not need to hear all of Elya\u2019s opinions, she wasn\u2019t going to pass up this valuable piece of intelligence.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Didn't know they sold company merchandise,\" Tanya said, worried about overspending. \"You didn't need to splurge just for me.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cI didn\u2019t realize any of them sold company merchandise,\u201d Tanya commented, a worry niggling at the back of her mind. At this rate, she was going to be in the red when it came to what they\u2019d decided they were willing to spend on each other. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to go to all that expense just for me.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha glanced around. \"I wouldn't say I had Elya buy them...\" ->", "completion": " Visha\u2019s eyes drifted around. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly say I had Elya buy them\u2026\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Elya likely charmed a waiter for a souvenir. Tanya was unsure about using such gifts for daily coffee. The thought of Elya's flirtation didn't seem to enhance her morning productivity. ->", "completion": " It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what method Elya had used to convince a waiter to let her walk away with a souvenir. All in all, Tanya wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about using her gifts for everyday coffee drinking. Starting her morning thinking about Elya batting her eyes at someone didn\u2019t sound likely to provide a productivity boost.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Tanya wondered about her boyfriend's feelings,\" she raised an eyebrow. ->", "completion": " \u201cI wonder how her boyfriend feels about that,\u201d Tanya mused, raising an eyebrow.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Visha chuckled, \"She can stealthily take anything. Once during training, she swiped an entire pie from the officer's cafeteria unnoticed.\" ->", "completion": " Visha snickered behind a hand again. \u201cThe truth is worse than that. She can sneak anything out of anywhere. During training one time she went over to the officer\u2019s section of the cafeteria and left with an entire pie in her bag without anyone noticing.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya failed as a friend, only showing a readiness to spend money for others, not break laws. ->", "completion": " As a friend, Tanya was obviously somewhat of a failure. She\u2019d merely proven a willingness to spend a bit of money on behalf of someone else, not to violate multiple laws.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"I'm unsure what it means to hang with you two,\" she joked, \"A thief and a card sharp. Your bad habits might influence me.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it says about me that I spend time with the two of you,\u201d she joked. \u201cA thief and a card sharp. Your degeneracy is going to rub off on me.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Already has,\" Visha retorted. \"Weiss said you could hustle billiards.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cAlready has,\u201d Visha shot back. \u201cWeiss said you could hustle some billiards tables.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Laughing, Tanya reached for her last gift: two copies of the same book, one in Cyrillic. She didn't recognize the title, Eugene Onegin. ->", "completion": " Tanya gave a bark of laughter as she reached for her final present. It was two books. The same book, actually, if she was transliterating the one written in Cyrillic correctly. The title Eugene Onegin wasn\u2019t ringing any bells.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Visha said, \u201cThe book made the name Tanya popular. Thought you'd find it funny to have a copy, even if you don't use the name.\u201d ->", "completion": " Visha shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the book that made the name Tanya popular,\u201d she explained. \u201cI thought you might find it a bit funny to have a copy.

{"prompt": "\"Not wanting to be disrespectful,\" Tanya said, \"I'm used to Army formalities. But you can use my first name now, and I'll call you whatever you prefer.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful,\u201d Tanya sniffed. \u201cMost people I know are through the Army.

{"prompt": "\"Call me Viktoriya or Visha,\" she smiled. \"Elya mispronounced it, but I'm used to it.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cViktoriya or Visha,\u201d she shrugged, flashing a smile. \u201cElya got my nickname a bit wrong, but I\u2019m used to it now.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Alright,\" Tanya nodded, collecting the discarded wrapping material. ->", "completion": " \u201cAlright,\u201d Tanya nodded, beginning to gather up the discarded wrapping material so she wasn\u2019t surrounded by a mess.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Is Tatiana your real name?\" Visha asked. ->", "completion": " \u201cIs your real name Tatiana?\u201d Visha questioned after a moment. \u201cI always meant to ask.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Perhaps,\" Tanya shrugged. \"But my mother wrote the orphanage before dying. She should've used my real name at least once.\" ->", "completion": " \u201cMaybe it was supposed to be,\u201d Tanya shrugged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think so. My mother sent a letter to the orphanage just before she died. You\u2019d think she\u2019d have mentioned me at least once by my proper name.\u201d\n###"}
{"prompt": "Despite implying her mother was somewhat rational, Tanya mainly viewed her biological parents as lacking. They were a fitting pair in that regard. ->", "completion": " Despite her words implying that her mother might have been a semi-rational human being, Tanya\u2019s primary impression of her biological parents was that as people, they had left a lot to be desired. In that sense, they\u2019d been a good match for each other.\n###"}
{"prompt": "She knew her father, Anton Zimmerman, a bit more due to his Army service record. Born in 1886 to a poor family near Berun, he died in Alsatia, 1913. She assumed her mother correctly identified him as her father. ->", "completion": " Overall, she knew slightly more about her father, owing to his record of service in the Army. Born to a destitute family northwest of Berun in 1886, died in Alsatia, 1913. She\u2019d give her mother the benefit of the doubt and assume she\u2019d correctly identified Anton Zimmerman as the other half of Tanya\u2019s equation.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Despite her mother living in Berun with better options, she got pregnant and could have at least found a financially stable man to assign paternity and offload her unwanted child. ->", "completion": " That wasn\u2019t saying much in her favor. As her mother had been living in Berun at the time, she\u2019d had plenty of better options to invite along for a roll in the hay. Once she realized she was pregnant, at the least she could have found someone financially stable to hop in bed with, assign paternity to, and foist her unwanted child off on.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Assuming Tanya was a Zimmerman descendant, she found living relatives but doubted their worth due to their unemployment. She feared they'd exploit her minor fame and small fortune. ->", "completion": " In any case, assuming Tanya was indeed a descendant of the Zimmerman clan, it wasn\u2019t a familial connection worth pursuing. She\u2019d identified a still-living uncle, some cousins, and a handful of more distant relatives she could claim, should she want to. Given their employment - or lack thereof, in many cases - she suspected that claiming them would result in more than a few hangers-on eager to share her dubious fame and meager fortune.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya only knew her maternal ancestors' last name. If they were significant, her mother wouldn't have died from tuberculosis in a poorhouse at age four. ->", "completion": " All Tanya knew about her maternal ancestry was the last name she shared with them. Presumably, if they\u2019d been people of note, her mother wouldn\u2019t have died of tuberculosis in a poorhouse when she was four.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Before her death, Anna Degurechaff left a letter, essentially apologizing for being a poor parent. Tanya, unimpressed by the apology and their shared genetics, considered it clutter. On her way to officer training, she gave the letter and other unnecessary personal items to Erna. ->", "completion": " Anna Degurechaff had left a letter prior to her death. It hadn\u2019t contained much in the way of usable information, and had basically amounted to a long apology for being a bad parent. While Tanya could appreciate a person who learned to take responsibility for their failures, neither that nor the simple fact that they shared some genetic code had seemed a good enough reason to accumulate clutter. The day the car came to take her to officer training, she\u2019d passed off the letter to Erna along with the other personal possessions she no longer had a use for.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Tanya shrugged, her mother's name offering no more insight into her heritage than suggesting she spoke an Indo-European language. ->", "completion": " With no good response, Tanya merely shrugged again. Her mother\u2019s given name gave her no clearer idea of her heritage than that she had probably been a native speaker of an Indo-European language.\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Perhaps she chose it because the rituals reminded her of the Orthodox Church,\" Visha mused. ->", "completion": " \u201cMaybe all the rituals just reminded her of the Orthodox Church, and that\u2019s why she chose it,\u201d Visha went on, nodding to herself.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Tanya smiled, appreciating her adjutant's foresight. She had predicted their impending lack of discussion topics, preventing idle gossip by suggesting a practical solution to maintain their conversation. ->", "completion": " Tanya nodded her acceptance with a smile. This was the very reason the other woman had made such a spectacular adjutant. She anticipated problems - this one being that they were soon going to run out of good discussion material and devolve into idle gossip to fill time - and had seamlessly suggested a solution that was both practical and kept the friendly flow of conversation going.\n###"}

Few women bothered with hair removal unless necessary.

For now, she could get away with it. She saw no need to remove hair she was used to having. Even with shortening hemlines on dresses, all that tended to be revealed underneath was stockings. Few women that didn\u2019t need to went to the trouble of hair removal. She could say with certainty that Visha\u2019s legs had only become hairless due to medical expediency.\n###"}
{"prompt": "If she'd wanted to explore Berun's nightlife on her eighteenth birthday, she could get used to seeing clean-shaven legs again, like the club dancers in photos.

In the photos she\u2019d seen of the dancers at the clubs, it looked like they engaged in the practice. For various reasons, she\u2019d rather not discover what went on in the city after midnight. Aside from the waste of time and money, she didn\u2019t need the back of her head plagued with concerns about how her old self would have judged either that decision nor the one she\u2019d made not to alter the natural state of her body.\n###"}

Even claiming she was being taken out to an expensive dinner hadn\u2019t been enough to rouse Ugar\u2019s voice out of subtle disappointment over her unadventurous plans.\n###"}

In this time, doctors' orders were unquestioned as most people only knew basic first aid and couldn't do independent research. ->", "completion": " Fortuitously, Tanya ran into the main doctor responsible for Visha\u2019s care in the hall. On account of her inquisitiveness, their relationship had started off a bit rocky. In this era, the doctor\u2019s orders were just that. Questions from patients or other concerned parties weren\u2019t the norm when the average person\u2019s medical knowledge was limited to basic first aid, and independent research was close to impossible.\n###"}

While she didn\u2019t particularly like having her contribution to Visha\u2019s life reduced to the level of Santa - a man celebrated for taking off 364 days out of the year - agreeing to play the part of an innocently curious girl had gotten him to do more than brush her questions off.\n###"}

She disliked habitual tardiness, but early arrivals were worse. ->", "completion": " By the time she\u2019d walked home, she barely had a minute to spare putting away her gifts when the door buzzed to indicate her next guest had arrived, almost thirty minutes ahead of schedule.

She remained disinterested in reality TV as before. ->", "completion": " If the trend continued, she was going to have to resort to pounding on the wall to remind her neighbors they weren\u2019t alone in the building. Living in trenches had taught her to sleep through any noise she didn\u2019t want to be woken up for. That was no cause to let her tolerance for such things be taken advantage of.

{"prompt": "Despite being an adult male, his constant harping about Geri suggested he hadn't grasped the concept of boundaries in society. ->", "completion": " Despite being what society would define as an adult male, the constant harangues of Geri this and Geri that, Geri, Geri, Geri, left her with the impression that this man had yet to learn about the concept of boundaries, or why they were important in a civilized society.\n###"}

His three children, identified by Tanya through their distinct voices, also scolded him by his first name. ->", "completion": " Geri\u2019s wife yelled at him for making passes at her sister. The sister yelled at Geri for thinking his in-law status exempted him from the pay-for-play business she had going on the weekends. Geri\u2019s children - three, by the different voices Tanya could hear - had even taken to yelling at their father by his given name.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The kids wanted him to find work. Tanya would soon advise the same and inform the adults that divorce was now easier under the new laws. ->", "completion": " At least they were on the right track. All the kids wanted was for him to get a job. Soon, Tanya was going to chime in with the same advice, as well as tipping the adult residents off that divorce had become somewhat easier to initiate under their new system of laws.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Erna used Tanya's extra pillow, usually for blocking noise, to aid her blissful ignorance. This gave her time to ponder Erna's recent request. ->", "completion": " Erna was using the extra pillow Tanya typically put over her head to assist in her quest of blissful ignorance. Waiting for the noise to stop gave her some time to think about Erna\u2019s last request.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Her wealthier, older coworkers likely wouldn't mind donating books they'd never read again. However, considering the young age and preferences of the orphanage's children, complex historical books wouldn't be suitable. ->", "completion": " As her coworkers trended older and wealthier than the average soldier, she imagined they wouldn\u2019t mind parting with a few titles they knew they\u2019d never read again. However, she had to consider the intended audience. Most of the orphanage\u2019s charges weren\u2019t old enough to digest complex and lengthy historical examinations. In all probability, even the ones who could weren't going to pick those up for fun.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Her female colleagues were more likely to admit they read non-academic books and have realistic views on children's literature. Good fatherhood was often equated with a stable job and strict discipline, discouraging fathers from truly knowing their children. ->", "completion": " The women she worked with were likely to be less averse to tacitly admitting they read books written for unserious, nonacademic consumption, as well as potentially having slightly more realistic opinions about what types of books kids wanted to read. The badge of good father could still be earned with a stable job and strict hand at discipline. Often, that provided something of a disincentive for getting to know your own children.\n###"}

It was a pleasant enough place to pass a few hours, for those who had that kind of time to spare.

{"prompt": "Many men served in the war, and upon recognizing his rank, they became formal. His free time felt owned by the public. Sometimes, he wished to be just Erich. ->", "completion": " Few enough able-bodied men had escaped serving in the war, and as soon as they registered his rank they tended to revert to a stiff formality even now. It made it so his free time wasn\u2019t really his own. Not in public, at least. There were days he wondered what it would be like to be Erich. Just Erich.\n###"}

For Tanya, who disliked both, he considered her caffeine addiction. ->", "completion": " Most years, he bought his adjutant something simple. A pack of cigarettes. A pack of beer.

{"prompt": "Coffeehouses weren't traditionally female-friendly, with few women visiting alone. Tanya, with her unique coffee preference, was an unforgettable presence for the staff. He'd never met anyone as memorable as her. ->", "completion": " Until recently, coffeehouses hadn\u2019t been the sorts of venues that were appropriate for women, and there were still relatively few of them who came alone to wile away a Sunday afternoon reading the paper. Fewer still who took their coffee the way Tanya did. It wasn\u2019t so surprising that she\u2019d be a memorable presence in the lives of the staff.

His taste didn't require such knowledge, similar to how some connoisseurs could discuss every wine strain and bottle. ->", "completion": " Lehrgen drew in a long breath through his cigarette, resigning himself to listening to a lecture on the flavor profiles of every different coffee bean the shop had in stock.

{"prompt": "He savored his first sip like a fine wine, skipping his usual cream. ->", "completion": " He closed his eyes for his first sip, tried to give it the same care he\u2019d extend to a fine wine. It was why he\u2019d foregone the cream he typically took.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The coffee tasted bitter, bold, and mellowed with hints of chocolate, cognac, floral notes, and a final twist of aniseed or caraway. ->", "completion": " The coffee was bitter on the tip of his tongue, bold and unapologetic. The acidity mellowed as it traveled further along, gaining hints of other flavors, hitting deep notes of chocolate or expensive cognac, barely there dashes of floral highs to offset, finishing with an unexpected twist - aniseed or caraway, he couldn\u2019t decide - to round it off.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The coffee wasn't for quick consumption or taste, but for savoring. Tanya's brand was decent. ->", "completion": " It wasn\u2019t a coffee he\u2019d drink for the taste alone, at least not by the metric of how easy it went down. It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d drink when he was looking for the quickest route to a morning fix. Its enjoyment was reserved exclusively for taking the time to savor it. As far as coffee went, Tanya\u2019s preferred brand wasn\u2019t half bad.\n###"}
{"prompt": "After stowing his bags in a gym locker, he felt the caffeine's effect and wondered why he didn't regularly consume it on Saturdays.

Jogging an extra kilometer came without an internal argument; he was halfway through a fourth set of weights before he realized it was one too many. When he caught sight of a familiar face unexpectedly - he\u2019d chosen the location specifically to avoid coworkers - he didn\u2019t mind being noticed.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The gift was more fitting for the occasion than a mere bag of coffee beans. It could ensure the return of his Waterman and possibly prevent future disappearances. ->", "completion": " It was a more appropriate gift for the occasion than a paltry bag of coffee beans.

The only word that came easily was Tanya\u2019s name. There was too much to say if he was serious about reflecting on where she\u2019d come from and where he hoped the next eighteen years would take her; too little to fill the page if he stuck with a perfunctory congratulations.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanya's voice snapped him from his thoughts, her questioning eyes on him. ->", "completion": " Her voice broke him away from his thoughts, still stuck on the first sentence, Tanya\u2014. Her eyes held a question for him once they saw it.\n###"}
