This repository is intended to allow you to copy an author's style using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. It creates prompt-completion pairs for each paragraph of a text, with the prompt being a GPT summmary, and the completion being the original text. These pairs are put in a .jsonl file which can then be used to fine-tune a 'davinci' GPT mode (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning).
